## VolumetricFlowBenchmark

This tool will generate a test G-Code that will help you quickly find the volumetric flow rate (mm^3/s) limit of your 3D printer hotend.

Simply clone or download the repository, open the HTML webpage, and edit the parameters as needed.

The tool is heavily inspired by the work Stefan Hermann @ CNC Kitchen. See his video for more information and usage.

### Notes

The tool has been tested on an Ender 3 Pro running **Klipper** using PETG and a 0.6mm nozzle, but should work with any printer running Marlin.
