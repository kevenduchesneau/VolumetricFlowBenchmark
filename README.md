## VolumetricFlowBenchmark

This tool will generate a test G-Code that will allow you to quickly find the volumetric flow rate (mm^3/s) limit of you hotend.

Simply clone or download, open the html webpage, and edit the parameters as needed.

The tool is heavily inspired by the work Stefan Hermann @ CNC Kitchen. See his video for more information and usage.

### Notes

The tool has been tested on an Ender 3 Pro running **Klipper** using PETG and a 0.6mm nozzle, but should work with any printer running Marlin.
